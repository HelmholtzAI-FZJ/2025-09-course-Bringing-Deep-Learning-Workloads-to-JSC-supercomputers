<section id="ai-and-supercomputing-course-introduction"
class="slide level2">
<h2>AI and Supercomputing Course Introduction</h2>
<p>Alexandre led a meeting to introduce a course on AI and
supercomputing at JSC. He explained the course objectives, including
ensuring all participants reach the same level of understanding and
using interactive sessions to address questions. The team discussed
accessing necessary materials, including a shared webpage with links to
training resources, GitLab, and slides. Alexandre provided an overview
of supercomputers, highlighting their architecture, including login
nodes, compute nodes, and the importance of high-speed networks. He also
introduced the Jureca DC supercomputer, detailing its specifications and
capabilities. The conversation ended with a brief explanation of batch
processing and Jupyter Notebooks, setting the stage for future
discussions on using supercomputers for AI tasks.</p>
</section>
<section id="supercomputer-usage-basics-training" class="slide level2">
<h2>Supercomputer Usage Basics Training</h2>
<p>Alexandre explained the basics of using a supercomputer, emphasizing
that jobs enter a queue and resources are shared among users. He
detailed the process of connecting to the login node, submitting jobs,
and using the system’s Jupyter environment for small-scale work.
Alexandre also covered the importance of using exclusive nodes and the
24-hour job limit, and he provided instructions for connecting to the
supercomputer using Visual Studio Code with SecureShell.</p>
</section>
<section id="ssh-configuration-for-supercomputers-setup"
class="slide level2">
<h2>SSH Configuration for Supercomputers Setup</h2>
<p>Alexandre guided participants through setting up SSH configurations
for connecting to supercomputers, addressing specific issues for
Windows, Linux, and Mac users. He provided step-by-step instructions for
creating and configuring SSH keys, managing IP restrictions, and
uploading public keys to the Jureca system. Participants, including
Salika and Mathi, received assistance with troubleshooting errors and
connecting to the remote systems. The session focused on ensuring
everyone could successfully connect to the supercomputers using Visual
Studio Code.</p>
</section>
<section id="ssh-setup-in-jureca-supercomputer" class="slide level2">
<h2>SSH Setup in Jureca Supercomputer</h2>
<p>Alexandre guided participants through setting up SSH connections to
the Jureca supercomputer using Visual Studio Code. He helped Scherer
successfully connect by configuring the SSH extension and accessing
remote files. Tak encountered permission issues with private key files
stored on a local drive, which Alexandre helped resolve by changing file
permissions and copying keys to the user directory. Somayeh was able to
connect via SSH but had issues with the SSH extension not displaying
properly in Visual Studio Code, which Alexandre addressed by
troubleshooting the configuration settings.</p>
</section>
<section id="ssh-and-vs-code-setup" class="slide level2">
<h2>SSH and VS Code Setup</h2>
<p>Alexandre guided participants through setting up SSH access and
Visual Studio Code for remote development on a supercomputer. He helped
Somayeh and Mathi resolve issues with accessing and configuring the SSH
keys, including correcting file paths and installing the necessary VS
Code extensions. The session concluded with participants successfully
accessing the correct working directory and opening terminals in VS
Code, with Alexandre confirming that everyone was set up properly for
the next steps.</p>
</section>
<section id="supercomputer-software-management-demonstration"
class="slide level2">
<h2>Supercomputer Software Management Demonstration</h2>
<p>Alexandre demonstrated how software is managed on the supercomputer,
explaining the module system which allows multiple versions of software
to be available without overwhelming the system. He showed how to search
for and load specific software modules using the module spider command,
and explained the hierarchy of modules including compiler, MPI, and
application levels. Alexandre also demonstrated how to copy files to the
supercomputer using the file browser interface, allowing users to work
directly with files stored on the system.</p>
</section>
<section id="supercomputer-matrix-multiplication-training-session"
class="slide level2">
<h2>Supercomputer Matrix Multiplication Training Session</h2>
<p>Alexandre led a session on running matrix multiplication code on a
supercomputer, explaining the difference between login nodes and compute
nodes, and the importance of using compute nodes with GPUs for machine
learning tasks. He demonstrated how to submit a job using Slurm,
including creating a batch script and submitting it with sbatch, and
showed how to monitor jobs using the squeue command. Alexandre also
explained the concept of reservations, which allows a group to reserve
specific resources on the supercomputer for a limited time, and in this
case, secured 20 nodes for 3 hours to run the matrix multiplication
code.</p>
</section>
<section id="supercomputer-code-execution-demonstration"
class="slide level2">
<h2>Supercomputer Code Execution Demonstration</h2>
<p>Alexandre demonstrated how to run code on a supercomputer, including
setting up files, installing software using a requirements file, and
creating a virtual environment. He explained the difference between
login nodes (which have internet access) and compute nodes (which
don’t), and showed how to download a dataset for a simple cats vs dogs
classification example. When attempting to run the full training script,
they encountered an internet connectivity issue on the compute node, so
Alexandre modified the approach to first download the dataset on the
login node before running the complete script.</p>
</section>
<section id="supercomputer-batch-processing-demonstration"
class="slide level2">
<h2>Supercomputer Batch Processing Demonstration</h2>
<p>Alexandre demonstrated how to submit batch files to the
supercomputer, explaining the process of using sbatch and monitoring
jobs through the command line. He showed how to use TensorBoard to
visualize training progress and explained the concept of port forwarding
to access web services on the supercomputer. Alexandre also introduced
Blahblador, an AI chatbot service available for free to help with coding
and questions about the system.</p>
</section>
<section id="supercomputing-resource-access-guidelines"
class="slide level2">
<h2>Supercomputing Resource Access Guidelines</h2>
<p>The meeting focused on discussing access and usage of supercomputing
resources, particularly the Jülich cluster. Alexandre explained how to
submit multiple jobs using job arrays in Slurm and recommended using
JUBE for organizing runs. He described the simple process for accessing
compute time through helmodes.ai, which doesn’t require a lengthy
proposal process. The discussion also covered software installation,
with Alexandre advising that users can install their own software when
practical, though complex installations are handled by the team.
Finally, Alexandre demonstrated how to access graphical applications
like ParaView and Blender on the cluster using remote desktop
functionality.</p>
